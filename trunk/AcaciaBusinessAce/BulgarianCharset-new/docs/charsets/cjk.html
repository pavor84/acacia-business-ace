<H1>The traditional CJK charsets</H1>

<H2>CJK Ideographs</H2>

<P>CJK is an acronym for "Chinese, Japanese, Korean".  What's common
to these three East Asian languages is that they all use a substantial
number of ideographic characters (several thousand, not enumerable
with 8 bits) historically dating back to the Chinese Han dynasty.
These Han ideographs are called <B>hanzi</B> in Chinese, <B>kanji</B>
in Japanese, and <B>hanja</B> in Korean and are unified as "<A
HREF="http://charts.unicode.org/unihan/unihan.acgi" >CJK
ideographs</A>" in Unicode.  For most ideographs, the pronunciation
varies between the different languages but the meaning is similar so
that Chinese text is somewhat comprehensible to Japanese readers.

<H2>CJK Syllabics</H2>

Besides the ideographs, syllabic scripts are used in Japanese and
Korean (interspersed with the Han ideographs): Japanese employs its
Kana alphabets (<B>Hiragana</B> and <B>Katakana</B>) and Korean its <A
HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/czyborra.com/unicode/characters.html#Hangul" >Hangul syllables</A>.

<H2>The first double-byte character set: JIS X 0208</H2>

The Japanese character set JIS X 0208 (originally named JIS C 6220)
was the first standardized charset to break the 8bit barrier in 1976.
In a way, it is an early Unicode because it also contained the basic
Greek and Cyrillic alphabets and symbols besides the Latin alphabet,
the Hiragana and Katakana syllables and the most important Kanji
(Chinese ideographs) required for Japanese.

<P>On X11, you can have a look at the JIS X 0208 code chart with the
command

<P><PRE>
	xfd -fn "*jisx0208*" &amp;
</PRE>

<P><IMG SRC="jisx0208.gif" ALT="[xfd screenshot: first page of JIS X 0208]">

<P>The JIS X 0208 characters are organized in 94 rows ("ku") of 94
cells ("ten") so that they can be mapped over the 94 printable G0
characters of ASCII as specified by <A HREF="iso2022.html" >ISO
2022</A>.  JIS X 0208 is thus structurally limited to 94×94 = 8'836
characters and with that low number no feasible replacement for
Unicode with its <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/czyborra.com/unicode/characters.html" >40'000+
characters</A>.  JIS X 0208 has been extended through a companion JIS
X 0212 holding a 94×94 grid of supplementary symbols, accented letters
and additional kanji, that can be accessed through <A
HREF="iso2022.html" >ISO-2022</A> shift sequences.

<P>JIS X 0208 was the first double-byte character set (<A NAME="DBCS"
>DBCS</A>).  There are various <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/czyborra.com/utf/#CES" >character encoding
schemes</A> to access these double-byte characters:

<UL><LI>mail-safe 7bit schemes using escape sequences, either


<UL><LI>the full <A HREF="iso2022.html" >ISO-2022</A> registered
escape sequences or

<LI>abbreviated <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1468.txt"
>ISO-2022-JP</A> or

</UL>


<LI>8bit projections like the

<UL><LI><PRE>ku/ten 01/01 => 7bit =21=21 + offset =80=80 => <A
HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/czyborra.com/utf/#EUC" >EUC</A> =A1=A1 </PRE>

for <B>EUC-JP</B> or

<LI>Microsoft's <B>Shift-JIS</B> (<A HREF="codepages.html#CP932"
>CP932</A>) codes floating around the halfwidth katakana codes found
in the 8bit range =A1..=DF of the first (1969) Japanese single-byte
8bit charset JIS X 0201.

</UL></UL>

<P>Much of this is described in <A
HREF="http://www.ora.com/people/authors/lunde/" >Ken Lunde</A>'s book
<A HREF="http://www.ora.com/catalog/ujip/" >Understanding Japanese
Information Processing</A> and its online companion <A
HREF="http://www.ora.com/people/authors/lunde/cjk_inf.html"
>CJK.INF</A>.

<P>On Unix/X11, the JIS X 0208 kanji can be used in the <A
HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/czyborra.com/unix/man.cgi/man1/kterm.1" >kterm</A> terminal emulator.

<H2>GB, KSC &amp; Co.: the Chinese and Korean national charsets</H2>

<P>Chinese and Korean standardizers followed the JIS X 0208 example
and defined their own 94×94 grids.  {ISO-2022,EUC}-{CN,TW,KR} are the
MIME labels used for these national standard coded character sets.  <A
NAME="GB2312" >GB 2312</A> is the Chinese equivalent to JIS X 0208
holding 6'763 hanzi, <A NAME="KSC5601" >KS C 5601</A> the Korean DBCS
holding 4'888 hanja and 2'350 Hangul syllables, and CNS 11643 Plane 1
the Taiwanese (Traditional Chinese) standard (albeit the not formally
specified industry-standard "Big5" is used more often in Taiwan).

<P>The Chinese terminal emulator <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/czyborra.com/unix/man.cgi/man1/cxterm.1"
>cxterm</A> can handle GB and Big5 hanzi using its own configurable
input dictionary.
