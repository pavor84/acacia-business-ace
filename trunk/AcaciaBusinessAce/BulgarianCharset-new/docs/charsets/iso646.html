<H1>Good ole' ASCII</H1>

The common denominator of all modern character sets like the ones from
<A HREF="iso8859.html" >ISO 8859</A> is the very successful American
Standard Code for Information Interchange (<B>ASCII</B>, /'æski:/)
which was published thirty years ago in 1968 as <A
HREF="http://web.ansi.org/default.htm" >ANSI</A> X3.4 and looks like
this:

<P><IMG SRC="iso646-us.gif"><BR>charset=US-ASCII
[<A HREF="iso646-us.txt.gz" >TXT</A>]
[<A HREF="iso646-us.bdf.gz" >BDF</A>]

<H2>Only <A NAME="EBCDIC" >EBCDIC</A> ignores ASCII</H2>

<P>Nowadays most computers use encodings based on ASCII.  The only
notable exception are the <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/" >IBM</A>
mainframes that never departed from the myriad of dialects of their
Extended Binary Coded Decimal Information Code (<B>EBCDIC</B>) that
predated ASCII and gave a more readable BCD coding on paper
punch-cards:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><IMG SRC="ebcdic-us.gif"><BR>charset=EBCDIC-US
[<A HREF="ebcdic-us.txt.gz" >TXT</A>]
[<A HREF="ebcdic-us.bdf.gz" >BDF</A>]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>US-ASCII is <A NAME="7bit" >7bit</A> only</H2>

<P>But back to ASCII: <IMG SRC="iso646-us.gif">

<P>Don't let your computer manufacturer tell you that there are ASCII
characters beyond those shown above.  ASCII uses only 7 bits and
allows the most significant <B>eighth bit</B> to be used as parity
bit, highlight bit, end-of-string bit (all of which are considered bad
practice nowadays) or to include additional characters for <A
HREF="iso8859.html" >internationalization</A> (i18n for which we need
8bit-clean programs that do none of afore-mentioned silly tricks) but
ASCII defined no <A HREF="iso8859.html" >standard</A> for this and
many manufacturers invented their own <A HREF="codepages.html"
>proprietary codepages</A>.

<H2>ISO-646: First attempts to <A NAME="i18n" >internationalize</A>
the 7bit code</H2>

<P>The only <B>languages</B> that can comfortably be written with the
repertoire of US-ASCII happen to be Latin, Swahili, Hawaiian and
American English without most typographic frills.  It is rumoured that
there are more languages in the world.

<P>That's why foreign standardizers crafted up <B>national
variants</B> of ASCII like the German DIN 66003 which my first CP/M
computer (a <A HREF="http://www.hh.schule.de/hhs/computer/mz700.htm"
>Sharp MZ-731</A>) used in 1984 to communicate with its daisy wheel
printer or the Danish DS 2089 mentioned by Bjarne Stroustrup in §
6.5.3 of his <A
HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0201543303" >C++
history</A>.  These 7bit charsets used the code positions of the less
needed ASCII characters

<PRE>
	# $ @ [ \ ] ^ ` { | } ~
</PRE>

to insert their accented letters so that

<PRE>
	,,schöne Grüße``
</PRE>

would get encoded as

<PRE>
	,,sch|ne Gr}~e``
</PRE>

and C programs like

<PRE>
	{*argv[1]='\0'}
</PRE>

showed up as

<PRE>
	æ*argvÆ1Å='Ø0'å
</PRE>

because C didn't offer alternative digraphs like Pascal's (. for [ and
(* for {.

<P>This is how these national variants looked like:

<P>ASCII and its national variants were declared international
standard <B>ISO 646</B> in 1972.  Back then, the socialist countries
managed to substitute the international currency sign ¤ for ASCII's
capitalist dollar sign $ in the the first international reference
version ISO-646-IRV but this was <A
HREF="http://www.ecma.ch/stand/ecma-006.htm" >revised in 1991</A> and
now ISO-646-IRV is a synonym for ISO-646-US or US-ASCII as it is used
in the core <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/" >Internet protocols</A>.
ISO-646's national variants have fallen out of use because of their
obvious problems and because the 8bit ASCII extension <A
HREF="iso8859.html#ISO-8859-1" >ISO-8859-1</A> has offered a more
interoperable standard.

<H2><A NAME="ISO-10646">ISO-10646/Unicode</A>: ASCII's ultimate
successor</H2>

<P><A HREF="iso8859.html" >ISO 8859</A> still isn't the ultimate
solution.  The even wider Universal Character Set (UCS, <A
HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/czyborra.com/unicode/standard.html" >Unicode</A>) wants to simplify
world-wide multilingual and multi-platform text exchange just like the
ASCII standard simplified Latin text interchange and aims to become
equally successful as <EM>the</EM> ultimate encoding standard and thus
it was numbered <A HREF="http://www.iso.ch/cate/d18741.html" >ISO
10646</A> = ISO 646 + 10000.  And the inevitable success seems to be
there:

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2070.txt" >RFC 2070</A>
internationalized the Internet's hypertext markup language HTML and
declared ISO 10646 its new base charset.

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2277.txt" >RFC 2277</A>
recommends the use of ISO 10646 to all new Internet protocols.

<P>Unicode begins with <A HREF="iso646.html" >US-ASCII</A> and <A
HREF="iso8859.html#ISO-8859-1" >ISO-8859-1</A> but goes beyond the
8bit barrier and encodes <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/czyborra.com/unicode/characters.html" >all the
world's characters</A> in a 16bit space and a 20bit extension zone for
everything that did not fit into the 16bit space.

The ASCII-compatible Unicode transformation scheme <A
HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/czyborra.com/utf/#UTF-8" >UTF-8</A> lets all ASCII characters pass through
transparently and encodes all other characters as unambiguous 8bit
character sequences.
