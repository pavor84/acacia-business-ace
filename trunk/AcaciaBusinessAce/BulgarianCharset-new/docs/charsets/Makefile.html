<H1>Making the charset illustrations</H1>

Even if Unix has no full Unicode support yet, Unicode can already be
used on Unix as a background encoding to manage various traditional
charsets as it is done by GNU recode, the Linux console, the Lynx
browser, the Kermit terminal program, or the Yudit editor.

<P>Another instance proving this thesis for me, is my little set of
scripts I wrote in May 1998 to maintain my charsets documentation:

Two self-written scripts make it easy to generate a font and an
illustration from a mere Unicode table instead of having to draw them
manually.

<P>For each charset, all I need is a <B>textual Unicode mapping
table</B> defining the coded character set, for example <A
HREF="iso8859-15.txt.gz" >iso8859-15.txt</A>:

<PRE>
=20     U+0020  SPACE
=21     U+0021  EXCLAMATION MARK
=22     U+0022  QUOTATION MARK
...
=A3     U+00A3  POUND SIGN
=A4     U+20AC  EURO SIGN
=A5     U+00A5  YEN SIGN
...
=BC     U+0152  LATIN CAPITAL LIGATURE OE
=BD     U+0153  LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE
=BE     U+0178  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS
...
=FE     U+00FE  LATIN SMALL LETTER THORN
=FF     U+00FF  LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS
</PRE>

<P>Unicode mapping tables have been freely available for many charsets
and new ISO standards such as the parts of ISO-8859 revised in 1998
come with explicit <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/czyborra.com/unicode/characters.html#unichar" >UCS
numbers</A>.

<P>Whenever new charsets are defined or errors in my tables are found,
I only have to edit the textual definition.

Then, with the unicoded mapping table I can simply say

<PRE>
make iso8859-15.{bdf,gif}
</PRE>

to automatically generate the matching <A HREF="iso8859-15.bdf.gz"
>bitmap font</A> and an illustrative <A HREF="iso8859-15.gif" >bitmap
GIF</A> showing the code chart:

<P><IMG SRC="iso8859-15.gif">

<P>This is accomplished through

<UL>

<LI>a script called <A HREF="fixtable" >fixtable</A> that brings the
mapping table into my canonical form,

<LI>a script called <A HREF="bdfassemble" >bdfassemble</A> to assemble
the font,

<LI>a script called <A HREF="bdftogif" >bdftogif</A> to draw the image, and

<LI>a <A HREF="Makefile" >Makefile</A> to put everything together

</UL>

<P>Beware that these scripts are poorly commented and still depend on
my local file hierarchy and are still using an older glyph storage
format that I originally had in mind for the <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/czyborra.com/unifont/" >GNU
unifont</A> with one file for each character.

<P>This is another trivial example of how Unicode can be useful in
Unix even though it is somewhat working behind the scenes.
