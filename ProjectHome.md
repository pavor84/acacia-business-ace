Acacia Business Ace is ERP+CRM like system which is designed to support small and medium size Enterprises. For base of this project will be used an existing DOS project written on Magic 4GL. Also I would like to include here all of my 18 years experience in many areas like Business Management, Design and Software Development, System Integration, Security and other. The core technologies and products which are used are Swing/SwingX, Java EE 5 (GlassFish), EJB3, JPA, Java Web Start (JNLP), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and others.
Some of the main modules which the system will include are:
- Business Management;

- Human Resources (HR, Recruiters);
- etc.
